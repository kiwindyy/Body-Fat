**Motivation**

1. *For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.*
    - This dataset was created to analyze body composition and predict body fat percentage using simpler, more accessible measurements. Accurate %body fat measurement can be complex and costly, so this dataset helps in creating prediction models using other physical measurements.
2. *Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?*
    - Developed by Brigham Young University's (BYU) Human Performance Research Center under the direction of Mark Ricard.
3. *Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.*
    - BYU Human Performance Research Center, details available at: [https://www.byu.edu/chhp/intro.html#lrc](https://www.byu.edu/chhp/intro.html#lrc)
4. *Any other comments?*
    - The dataset is relevant for health, fitness, and statistical research. 

**Composition**

1. *What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.*
	- Each instance represents measurements of a male participant, including body density, body fat percentage, weight, height, and various circumferences (e.g., neck, chest, abdomen).
2. *How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?*
	- 250 male participants.
3. *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).*
	- The dataset is a controlled sample of men of various ages. It is not randomized or geographically diverse.
4. *What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.*
	- Raw numerical data, including weight (in pounds), height (in inches), and circumferences (in inches).
	- Body fat percentage, a value derived from body density.
5. *Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.*
	- Percentage Body Fat (%BF), accurately measured using specialized equipment.
6. *Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.*
	- No missing data is evident in the dataset.
7. *Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for example, users' movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.*
	- Variables like weight, abdomen circumference, and height have measurable connections with %body fat.
8. *Are there recommended data splits (for example, training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.*
	- The dataset does not come with predefined splits, leaving users the flexibility to create their own training, validation, and test sets.
9. *Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.*
	- Minor variations in measurements may exist but are not documented.
10. *Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (for example, websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (that is, including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (for example, licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a dataset consumer? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.*
	- The dataset is self-contained and can be accessed directly via DASL [@dasl]
11. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (for example, data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals' non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- The dataset is anonymized, containing no personally identifiable information.
12. *Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why.*
	- None.
13. *Does the dataset identify any sub-populations (for example, by age, gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.*
	- TBD
14. *Is it possible to identify individuals (that is, one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (that is, in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how.*
	- The dataset represents males, with no explicit data on race, ethnicity, or geographic distribution.
15. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (for example, data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- Not possible.
16. *Any other comments?*
	- Contains health-related data (e.g., %body fat) but no personal or private data.

**Collection process**

1. *How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly observable (for example, raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (for example, survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (for example, part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)? If the data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.*
	- Measurements were collected through standard anthropometric techniques, supplemented with accurate %body fat calculations based on body density.
2. *What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data (for example, hardware apparatuses or sensors, manual human curation, software programs, software APIs)? How were these mechanisms or procedures validated?*
	- Likely involved common health assessment tools and equipment.
3. *If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling strategy (for example, deterministic, probabilistic with specific sampling probabilities)?*
	- A non-random, controlled sample of male participants from BYUâ€™s study pool.
